# ZS_News_Sentiment

It is a NLP Problem where one has to predict the sentiment of Title and Sentiment of Headline for the given Title, Headline published in the News.
Given dataset has 11 variables out of which title, headline are used to predict the sentiment score.

I have used LSTM Deep Learning Model as my base Model and acquired 94.71 Score on Leader Board.

I have also tried, XGBoost, TF-IDF Dense Network but LSTM Model outperforms all.
